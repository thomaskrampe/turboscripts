# turbscripts

The un-official repository for Turbo.net build scripts for internal projects.

## What is a `turbo.me` file?

`turbo.me` files are TurboScripts that contain instructions to automatically package applications. By
convention, packaging scripts are named `turbo.me` and placed in the root of a repository.

Turbo containers can be shared on the [turbo.net](http://turbo.net) online hub.
